         I am 18 years old teenager who is preparing for college.I'm still confused and don't
        know which major to choose in college.I started to learn programming in October 2021 but due to some
        circumstances,I have to stop for a while.I studied properly again in February 2022 from MSquare Programming
        YouTube channel and freecodecamp website.I studied hard but I didn't make that much progress.I felt lost for a
        while.I attended programming course from online which taught me from basic to laravel,vue in the 23rd of April,
        2022.I attended to revise everything I learned about HTML and CSS.This movie project is my first one which I do it
        on my own.But I had to ask for help to my mentor and my friend for something I did't know.I also had to search a lot
        in Google.As this is my first project,I couldn't guarantee that this is very responsive and good.But I believe I wil 
        be able to create many amazing projects in the future.<br><br>P.S. I copied the paragraphs about movies which are written
        under the title "Things you need to know" from Wikipedia.
