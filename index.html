      <div>The film tells the parallel love stories of a mother and daughter.
          The story of the mother is told partially in flashbacks.The daughter, Ji-hye and the mother, Joo-hee are played
         by the same actress,Son Ye-jin.Ji-hye is cleaning up her house and find a box full of love letters about her mother's
         relationship with first love.Periodically in the movie, Ji-hye reads one of these letters, which starts a flashback
          scene in which the story of the mother is told.These flashbacks are intertwined with Ji-hye's own story, in which
           she falls for a fellow student, Sang-min (Jo In-sung), who is involved with the school theater.The movie tells
          the story of both relationships.It was released in 2003.Cho Seung-woo,Seo Young-hee and Lee Ki-woo are also starring in this film.</div>
          <h2>My opinion</h2>
          <span>This is the one of the best korean Y2K film and it's also one of my favourite.I was watching 
             Crush Landing On You which is released in 2019.Son Ye-jin is starring in that series.Although she's
             not as young as in the movie Classic,she's still beautiful and charming.When I watch Classic, I could see
             the young and gorgeous Son Ye-jin.I love her a lot.

       Love Letter became a box-office hit in Japan and later in other east Asian countries, most
      notably South Korea, where it was one of the first Japanese films to be shown in cinemas
      since World War II. In South Korea it was the tenth highest grossing general release of
       the year with 645,615 admissions.Director Shunji Iwai hired Noboru Shinoda as cinematographer
       and the collaboration between the two produced a film praised for its evocative winter cinematography.
      <h2>My Opinion</h2>
      I love this 90s japanese movie.I love its cinematography which is with the beauty of snow and winter.
      The plot is mysterious and I couldn't understand at first.But later,I understand gradually and I start 
      to love it.I love the idea of plot writer,Shunji Iwai who is also the film director of this movie.As I am
      weeb,I love to see the japanese teenage life in 90s.

      Gone with the Wind is a 1939 American epic historical romance film adapted from the 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell.
       The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming.
       Set in the American South against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era, the film tells
      the story of Scarlett O'Hara (portrayed by Vivien Leigh), the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner,
      following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton
       (Olivia de Havilland), and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).
      <h2>My Opinion</h2>
      I intimated Gone with the Wind by the book of Mya Than Tint,the burmese writer who translated many well-known novels.
      I have never read this book with the original language but I'm familiar every character and their personality.It's difficult
      to set a role model in this novel.Every character has flaws and good habits.Every cast in the movie can portray their character
      perfectly.Normally,I didn't expect the movie to be good as the book but this movie is exception.

         Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American teen comedy-drama film written by Tom Schulman, directed by Peter Weir, and starring
          Robin Williams. Set in 1959 at the fictional elite conservative Vermont boarding school Welton Academy,[4] it tells the
          story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.
          The film was a commercial success and received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Director,
           Best Picture, and Best Actor for Robin Williams. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film,[5] the César Award for Best
          Foreign Film and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Film. Schulman received an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work.
        <h2>My Opinion</h2>
        This film's really amazing.It's about the group of young friends and extraordinary english teacher who is revolting the old-fashionable
        learning style of English literature and conservative philosophy in society.It's delightful to see the youngsters having fun in their teenage life 
        but there's something tragic comes up because of Neil Perry,one of the students in the boarding school.His dad wants him to be
        a doctor but he wants to be an actor.As the conflict between father and son becomes bigger,the tragic things become.

         Before Sunrise is a 1995 romantic drama film directed by Richard Linklater and co-written by Linklater and Kim Krizan.
          The first installment in the Before trilogy, it follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) as they meet on
           a Eurail train and disembark in Vienna to spend the night together.Inspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated
          with Krizan, who previously appeared in his films Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993), to develop the screenplay.
           Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast, with the pair also contributing uncredited rewrites.
          Principal photography took place entirely in Vienna.
        <h2>My Opinion</h2>
        One of my favourite romance movies.It's very simple beacuse most of the movie scenes are portrayed with the conversation
        between Jesse and Celine.Their conversations are very interesting.It's about politics,art and something like that.I could
        see the beauty of Vienna city in there.The other two movies are also good and minimalistic like before sunrise.The timeline
        in the movie and the movie released year are the same which make the films better.

      <h2>Things you need to know</h2>
      In the Mood for Love is a 2000 romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Wong Kar-wai.
       A co-production between Hong Kong and France, it portrays a man (Tony Leung) and a woman (Maggie Cheung)
        whose spouses have an affair together and who slowly develop feelings for each other.The film premiered
         at the Cannes Film Festival on 20 May 2000,[4] to critical acclaim and a nomination for the Palme d'Or;
          Leung won Best Actor (the first Hong Kong actor to win the award). It is often listed as one of the 
          greatest films of all time and one of the major works of Asian cinema.
     <h2>My Opinion</h2>
     I have watched three films of Wong Kar-wai's.Almost every film that he directed are written by himself.I have
     watched Fallen Angles and Chungking Express.The plots are advanced and unique but I don't like it.In this film,
     he make the plot just like the other movies.It's about the aberrant nature of human and I like it.The plot's mature
     and realistic.Wong didn't romanticize in this movie.He ends the movie with what should have to be.

         Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 epic crime film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and
          starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. The film is an Italian-American[3] venture produced by The Ladd Company,
           Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros.
          Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of best friends David "Noodles" Aaronson and
          Maximilian "Max" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters
          in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed,
          betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.
        <h2>My Opinion</h2>
        I am not a fan of gangster movies but after watching this film,I start to like them but I haven't watch The Godfather
        trilogy.I decided to watch them one day.I like the acting of Robert De Niro.As there're flashbacks in the movie,he acts
        in many characters like young and active middle-aged man and pale old man.Although the movie's running time is a bit
        long,It's a good movie which can give the appreciation.
